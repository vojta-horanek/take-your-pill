# Take your Pill
An app that reminds you to take your pills. Developed as my long-term graduation work.

## Roadmap
- see progress in GitHub Projects

### Planned features
- remind at specific time of day (multiple times)
- remind only for n days, then stop reminding
- resume reminding after m days
- use a notification or an alarm style alert (fullScreenIntent)
  - user can chose priority for each pill
- edit pill details
  - photo, name etc..
- confirm the user took the pill
- view history of pill taking
  - kind of a medical record of pills

### Would like to have features
- scan and add pills from eRecepty
- scan and add pill from its barcode
- add pills from a central database
  - this will have the usual dosage etc
- a map of pharmacies, preferably using OpenStreetMaps
- remind that you will be running out of pills shortly
- adding custom values to the app calendar 
  - like hearth rate, body pressure, etc..

### Not happening
- multiplaform (only android)
- i11n
  - the app itself will be translated to english, but specific features will not be supported outside Czechia
